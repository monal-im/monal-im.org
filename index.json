In detail these information consists of:\n The Apple push token The timestamp of the last push error The timestamp of the last successful push The timestamp of the registration of your device with Monal’s push-server The timestamp when the registration was renewed A random UUID identifying your device A random secret used by your XMPP server to authenticate a push  Additionally, your local device will contain a log file with all sent and received raw XMPP messages as well as debug logs.

We successfully managed to transform Monal from an app that had flaws and issues with many functions to a level that promotes a user-friendly experience with working features such as push notification, group chat, and partially end-to-end encryption support (OMEMO). If you are selecting an XMPP client for Apple systems we think that Monal is a great choice nowadays. We have been investing more than a thousand hours and worked hard to overcome all the flaws, the legacy app had. We invite you to give the recent beta a try!\nThe development of Monal has not yet finished though, and many more features are hopefully to come. But due to our time constraints, it sometimes takes a bit longer than we and the community would like. We are at most two developers at the moment using our spare time to maintain Monal and develop new features. As we are developing Monal in our spare time without decent funding, it is sometimes hard to prioritize specific features. Please give this circumstance some credits.\nWhat should Monal look like in the future? To give you a bit of insight knowledge of our plans we tried to summarize the most important tasks.\nInterface (SwiftUI) In the future Monal should be easy to use. Therefore, the interface requires a proper rework and while we are at it, it should be ported to SwiftUI. While we are still improving in designing with SwiftUI, we would be glad if there is a SwiftUI \u0026amp; Open Source enthusiast who would like to help us with this.\nWith this transition we would like to improve the accessibility of the app as well. If you like to support an open source project, and you would like to be part of our SwiftUI journey please contact us.\nTask:\n Add new MUC creation and management UI Port the chat view Finish contact Details  List group chat (MUC) participants Display OMEMO encryption fingerprints for verification   Port our settings Port all other remaining views  Qualifications:\n General knowledge around SwiftUI (iOS and Catalyst) Interest in improving a (XMPP) chat client Optional, but preferred: Some experience with XMPP (e.g. some weeks, or maybe months of usage of Monal or any other “modern” XMPP client) Optional: Experience in designing inclusive / accessible UI  Website We need a modern (simplified) Hugo based website that is easier to understand, similar to Conversations, Dino or Gajim.\nIf you have some spare time, and you are a skilled in creating websites with Hugo please contact us.\nRequirements:\n Simple design nothing too fancy Privacy by design → No analytics, no external CSS, jss, … usage  OMEMO Encryption in Group Chat (MUC) We started to integrate OMEMO for group chats (MUC) into our alpha build. The receiving and sending sides are already implemented, but there are a few more steps until we can release it into the beta.\nSwitching to our new Domain monal-im.org In late 2021 we decided that we would like to have a domain with DNSSEC as our current top level domain does not support it. This domain will mainly be used for our push servers and mail servers in the future. From now on you will be able to reach us via info@monal-im.org.\nBuild server Thanks to ~20 generous donors, we were able to buy a new build server that will be used to build our alpha, beta and stable releases. Furthermore, Thilo is now finally able to debug code with a proper debugger connected to his phone.\nRedundant Push Servers We are currently using an AWS US instance for our push server that is not redundant and failed in 2021 more frequently than we liked it to. For that reason we started an internal project to auto-deploy our push server with Ansible and looked into ways for running a redundant push server setup. The first tests look promising so far, but a few more things need to be sorted out before we can switch over to our new setup.\nBefore we can switch to the new push server setup, we need a stable funding each month. We estimate that renting a VM in Germany and one at a different hoster in Finland would cost us between 16€ to 32€ each month. Without a stable funding we might not be able to afford this new setup and our push servers would stay in the US.\nThanks to our generous build server donors, we have a few bucks left that will be used as a ~5 month buffer in case of fluctuant push server funding\nPrivacy improved push servers With our current push implementation our so-called “app servers” see your JID (username + server), a unique but otherwise opaque device id and an opaque token generated by apple, as well as your interaction times (when you register for push notifications, timestamps when your XMPP server triggers a push notification device).\nIf you use multiple accounts on one device, the unique device id is shared across all accounts. We don’t think that this is ideal, as we know all jid’s a user is using.\nIn the future we want to try to reduce our knowledge by hiding your username from our app servers. If our idea works, we would only see that a device is registered on one or more domains and the timestamps that a push message was triggered from each domain that is used.\nAudio and Video Calls Many clients such as Conversations and Dino support audio and video calls, so Monal should be next 🙂\nEnd-of-life: iOS 12, iOS 13 and macOS Catalina will not be supported anymore Our user group on iOS 12, iOS 13 as well as macOS Catalina has decreased in last years while the resources needed to maintain these old platforms increased. We therefore decided to focus on newer iOS versions and drop the old ones. The next stable release will only be supported on iOS 14 and higher and macOS Big Sur and higher. We are still unsure how long we will support iOS 14, as most of the devices also support iOS15.\nDonations and Support Monal is developed by volunteers and community collaboration.

Bir SwiftUI geliştiricisi arıyoruz. Basitleştirilmiş yeni bir web sitesine ihtiyacımız var. Daha iyi sürekli finansmanla, push sunucularımız ABD\u0026rsquo;den Avrupa\u0026rsquo;ya taşınacak. Yeni bir destek postamız var: info@monal-im.org\n İki yıl önce, iOS ve macOS için başka bir XMPP İstemcisi oluşturmak yerine Monal uygulamasını neredeyse tamamen yeniden yazmaya ve süreç içinde aşamalı olarak iyileştirmeye karar verdik. Monal\u0026rsquo;ı birçok işlevle ilgili kusurları ve sorunları olan bir uygulamadan, anında iletme bildirimi, grup sohbeti ve kısmen uçtan uca şifreleme desteği (OMEMO) gibi çalışma özellikleriyle kullanıcı dostu bir deneyimi destekleyen bir düzeye dönüştürmeyi başardık. Apple sistemleri için bir XMPP istemcisi seçiyorsanız, Monal\u0026rsquo;ın günümüzde harika bir seçim olduğunu düşünüyoruz. Eski uygulamanın sahip olduğu tüm kusurların üstesinden gelmek için bin saatten fazla yatırım yaptık ve çok çalıştık. Sizi en son betayı denemeye davet ediyoruz!\nMonal\u0026rsquo;ın gelişimi henüz bitmedi ve daha birçok özelliğin gelmesini umuyoruz. Ancak zaman kısıtlamalarımız nedeniyle, bazen bizim ve topluluğun istediğinden biraz daha uzun sürüyor. Şu anda boş zamanımızı Monal\u0026rsquo;ı korumak ve yeni özellikler geliştirmek için kullanan en fazla iki geliştiriciyiz. Monal\u0026rsquo;ı boş zamanlarımızda yeterli finansman olmadan geliştirdiğimiz için, belirli özelliklere öncelik vermek bazen zor olabilir. Lütfen bu duruma biraz kredi verin.\nMonal gelecekte nasıl görünmeli? Size planlarımız hakkında biraz bilgi vermek için en önemli görevleri özetlemeye çalıştık.\nArayüz (SwiftUI) Gelecekte Monal\u0026rsquo;ın kullanımı kolay olmalıdır. Bu nedenle, arayüz uygun bir yeniden çalışma gerektiriyor ve biz hazırken SwiftUI\u0026rsquo;ye taşınması gerekiyor. SwiftUI ile tasarım konusunda gelişmeye devam ederken, bu konuda bize yardımcı olmak isteyen bir SwiftUI \u0026amp; Açık Kaynak meraklısı varsa çok seviniriz. Bu geçişle birlikte uygulamanın erişilebilirliğini de geliştirmek istiyoruz. Bir açık kaynak projesini desteklemek isterseniz ve SwiftUI yolculuğumuzun bir parçası olmak istiyorsanız lütfen bizimle iletişime geçin.\nGörev:\n Yeni MUC oluşturma ve yönetim kullanıcı arayüzü ekleyin Sohbet görünümünü taşıyın İletişim Detaylarını Bitir  Grup sohbeti (MUC) katılımcılarını listeleyin Doğrulama için OMEMO şifreleme parmak izlerini görüntüleyin   Ayarlarımızı taşıyın Kalan tüm görünümleri taşıyın  Nitelikler:\n SwiftUI (iOS ve Catalyst) hakkında genel bilgi Bir (XMPP) sohbet istemcisini geliştirmeye ilgi İsteğe bağlı, ancak tercih edilen: XMPP ile biraz deneyim (örneğin, Monal veya başka bir \u0026ldquo;modern\u0026rdquo; XMPP istemcisinin birkaç hafta veya belki aylarca kullanımı) İsteğe bağlı: Kapsayıcı / erişilebilir kullanıcı arayüzü tasarlama deneyimi  İnternet sitesi Conversations, Dino veya Gajim\u0026rsquo;e benzer, anlaşılması daha kolay, modern (basitleştirilmiş) Hugo tabanlı bir web sitesine ihtiyacımız var.\nBoş zamanınız varsa ve Hugo ile web siteleri oluşturma konusunda yetenekliyseniz, lütfen bizimle iletişime geçin.\nGereksinimler:\n Basit tasarım çok süslü bir şey değil Tasarım gereği gizlilik → Analiz yok, harici CSS, jss, … kullanımı yok  Grup Sohbetinde (MUC) OMEMO Şifrelemesi Grup sohbetleri için OMEMO\u0026rsquo;yu (MUC) alfa yapımıza entegre etmeye başladık. Alıcı ve gönderen taraflar zaten uygulandı, ancak beta sürümüne yayınlayabilmemiz için birkaç adım daha var.\nYeni Alan adımıza geçiş monal-im.org 2021\u0026rsquo;in sonlarında, mevcut üst düzey alan adımız bunu desteklemediğinden DNSSEC içeren bir alan adı almak istediğimize karar verdik. Bu alan adı, gelecekte esas olarak push sunucularımız ve posta sunucularımız için kullanılacaktır. Artık bize info@monal-im.org adresinden ulaşabileceksiniz.\nSunucu oluştur ~20 cömert bağışçı sayesinde, alfa, beta ve kararlı sürümlerimizi oluşturmak için kullanılacak yeni bir yapı sunucusu satın alabildik. Ayrıca, Thilo nihayet telefonuna bağlı uygun bir hata ayıklayıcı ile kodda hata ayıklayabiliyor.\nYedekli Push Sunucuları Şu anda push sunucumuz için yedekli olmayan ve 2021\u0026rsquo;de istediğimizden daha sık başarısız olan bir AWS ABD örneği kullanıyoruz. Bu nedenle, push sunucumuzu Ansible ile otomatik olarak dağıtmak için dahili bir proje başlattık ve yedekli bir push sunucusu kurulumu çalıştırmanın yollarını aradık. İlk testler şu ana kadar umut verici görünüyor, ancak yeni kurulumumuza geçmeden önce birkaç şeyin daha çözülmesi gerekiyor.\nYeni push sunucusu kurulumuna geçmeden önce, her ay istikrarlı bir finansmana ihtiyacımız var. Almanya\u0026rsquo;da bir sanal makine ve Finlandiya\u0026rsquo;da farklı bir barındırıcıda bir sanal makine kiralamanın bize her ay 16€ ile 32€ arasında bir maliyeti olacağını tahmin ediyoruz. İstikrarlı bir fon olmadan bu yeni kurulumu karşılayamayabiliriz ve push sunucularımız ABD\u0026rsquo;de kalır.\nCömert yapı sunucusu bağışçılarımız sayesinde, dalgalanmalı sunucu finansmanı durumunda ~5 aylık bir tampon olarak kullanılacak birkaç dolarımız kaldı.\nGizlilik geliştirilmiş push sunucuları Mevcut push uygulamamızla, sözde \u0026ldquo;uygulama sunucularımız\u0026rdquo; JID\u0026rsquo;nizi (kullanıcı adı + sunucu), benzersiz ancak aksi takdirde opak bir cihaz kimliğini ve apple tarafından oluşturulan opak bir belirteci ve etkileşim sürelerinizi (push bildirimleri için kaydolduğunuzda) görür. , XMPP sunucunuz bir anında iletme bildirim cihazını tetiklediğinde zaman damgaları). Bir cihazda birden fazla hesap kullanıyorsanız, benzersiz cihaz kimliği tüm hesaplar arasında paylaşılır. Bir kullanıcının kullandığı tüm jid\u0026rsquo;leri bildiğimiz için bunun ideal olduğunu düşünmüyoruz. Gelecekte, kullanıcı adınızı uygulama sunucularımızdan gizleyerek bilgimizi azaltmaya çalışmak istiyoruz. Fikrimiz işe yararsa, yalnızca bir cihazın bir veya daha fazla etki alanında kayıtlı olduğunu ve kullanılan her etki alanından bir push mesajının tetiklendiği zaman damgalarını görürdük.\nSesli ve Görüntülü Aramalar Conversations ve Dino gibi birçok istemci sesli ve görüntülü aramaları destekler, bu nedenle Monal bir sonraki olmalıdır 🙂\nKullanım ömrü sonu: iOS 12, iOS 13 ve macOS Catalina artık desteklenmeyecek iOS 12, iOS 13 ve macOS Catalina\u0026rsquo;daki kullanıcı grubumuz son yıllarda azalırken, bu eski platformların bakımı için gereken kaynaklar arttı. Bu nedenle, daha yeni iOS sürümlerine odaklanmaya ve eskilerini bırakmaya karar verdik. Bir sonraki kararlı sürüm yalnızca iOS 14 ve sonraki sürümlerde ve macOS Big Sur ve sonraki sürümlerde desteklenecektir. Cihazların çoğu iOS15\u0026rsquo;i de desteklediğinden, iOS 14\u0026rsquo;ü ne kadar süre destekleyeceğimizden hala emin değiliz.\nBağış ve Destek Monal, gönüllüler ve topluluk işbirliği ile geliştirilmiştir. Yapılan iş genellikle ödenmez ve geliştiricilerin gelecekte hizmet maliyetlerini ve geliştirmeyi sürdürmeleri gerekir! Lütfen yürütülen sıkı çalışma için biraz geri vermeyi düşünün. Şu anda Monal gelişimini finansal olarak desteklemenin üç yolu vardır:\n GitHub Sponsorları aracılığıyla bağış yapın Libera Pay aracılığıyla bağış yapın AB vatandaşları da ÖÇKB aracılığıyla bağışta bulunabilirler. IBAN\u0026rsquo;ını almak için info@monal-im.org adresine posta yoluyla Thilo Molitor ile iletişime geçmeniz yeterlidir.  Burada daha fazla geliştirme desteği hakkında bilgi edinebilirsiniz!
