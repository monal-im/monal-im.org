[{"content":"SASL (Simple Authentication and Security Layer) as used in XMPP is broken. In this blog post I\u0026rsquo;ll try to explain why and propose some fixes.\nUpdate: Since I originally wrote this blog post, I\u0026rsquo;ve had the ability to discuss several of my solutions with Dave (the original author of XEP-0388 dubbed SASL2) and MattJ (one of the authors of the prosody xmpp server) and others. Most, if not all of my issues are now addressed in a bunch of updates to existing XEPs as well as new XEPs:\nUpdate of XEP-0388 (SASL2): https://github.com/xsf/xeps/pull/1214 New ProtoXEP for downgrade protection when using SCRAM: https://github.com/xsf/xeps/pull/1216 Already existing XEP that only now gets adopted by server developers: XEP-0440 The rest of this blog post remains as is and can be used for a deeper introduction into the material and as explanation of some of the rationale behind the SASL2 updates and my ProtoXEP.\nA Modern Authentication Protocol In my opinion a modern authentication protocol should have at least the following properties. Of course that can be subject to debate, but I think most of us will agree on the following list.\nallow for protocol agility (e.g. adding new authentication mechanisms, like adding new cipher suites in TLS) prevent downgrade attacks on authentication mechanisms (we don\u0026rsquo;t want an active attacker to be able to force us to use a weak mechanism) prevent storage of plaintext passwords on the server (that\u0026rsquo;s obvious: we don\u0026rsquo;t want a hacker to be able to steal our plaintext passwords once he hacked the database) prevent replay attacks (we don\u0026rsquo;t want a MITM (man in the middle) be able to steal a (possibly hashed) password and use it to authenticate herself) (possibly) prevent/detect MITM altogether How SASL tries to fulfill these properties First of all: XMPP Core mandates the use of TLS for everything, including authentication. Keep that in mind, when reading the rest of this blog post.\nProperty 1 SASL as defined for XMPP allows the server to present a list of authentication methods. The client then picks the one having the highest perceived strength (see XMPP-Core 6.3.3) among the ones it implements. XEP-0438: Best practices for password hashing and storage lists some common authentication methods and how they should be ordered. Currently, the methods PLAIN (plaintext password), EXTERNAL (using client certificates to authenticate the user) and SCRAM (Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism) are common.\n(I will not talk about SASL EXTERNAL in this blog post, because it does not use passwords and seems to be super uncommon in the XMPP world.)\nThis generally allows adding new mechanisms in the future, protocol agility seems to be fulfilled, right?\nProperty 3 Current mandatory SASL methods include SCRAM-SHA-1 and SCRAM-SHA-1-PLUS (if possible). SCRAM generally allows the server to store a salted hash instead of plaintext passwords.\nEven if the client uses the PLAIN method, the server could store the password as salted hash.\nAnd EXTERNAL usually does not use any form of password.\nSo that\u0026rsquo;s another property of our list that is fulfilled, right?\nProperty 4 Using SCRAM it is even possible to prevent replay attacks because of the used challenge-response scheme. That\u0026rsquo;s even possible if no TLS channel is used.\nCool, another property that\u0026rsquo;s fulfilled by SCRAM as well, right?\nProperty 5 SCRAM is even cooler because it allows for TLS channel-binding.\nThis allows both entities (client and server) taking part in the SCRAM authentication to bind the authentication to the TLS channel using a HMAC (Hash-Based Message Authentication Code) to sign a unique data blob tied to the TLS session in use.\nIf the TLS channel is intercepted by a MITM, the attacker would have to use two separate TLS channels, one to the server and one to the client.\nBinding the authentication to the TLS channel allows the server and client to detect such an attacker and fail the authentication.\nTo indicate, that a server supports channel-binding, it appends the string -PLUS to the advertised SCRAM methods.\nIf the client supports channel-binding, it picks SCRAM-SHA-1-PLUS instead of SCRAM-SHA-1.\nIn case the client supports channel-binding, but only received methods without channel-binding, the client uses the SCRAM method without -PLUS, but also indicates that it would have used the PLUS varriant if offered by the server (SCRAM Channel Binding).\nThis allows for the server to detect downgrade attacks and fail the authentication.\nBecause there are multiple different kinds of channel-binding to TLS possible, the client also specifies which binding it uses during the SCRAM flow (protocol agility).\nChannel binding prevents MITM altogether, right? Another property that\u0026rsquo;s fulfilled!\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s broken with SASL in XMPP Cautious readers will have noticed, that I left out property 2 (downgrade attack prevention) in my above explanation. That\u0026rsquo;s because SASL does not prevent downgrade attacks regarding the method negotiation at all. And that\u0026rsquo;s one of the main reasons why the whole SASL in XMPP stuff is so horribly broken.\nDowngrade of SASL methods The XMPP Core RFC even mentions downgrade attacks and suggests using TLS to mitigate them. But that\u0026rsquo;s not enough. If we assume the TLS channel to always be secure and MITM-free, we don\u0026rsquo;t even need SCRAM but could solely use PLAIN. The TLS channel already ensures no replay attacks can happen and storing the passwords securely using salted hashes on the server is still possible. We don\u0026rsquo;t need any channel-binding either, because that\u0026rsquo;s only needed if we assume someone has tampered with the TLS channel in the first place. In this scenario MITM-Prevention (property 5) is simply out of scope for SASL, because we assume TLS to always be MITM-free. That means our properties mentioned above are all fulfilled (property 5 by definition, the other ones by use of TLS) even if we abandon SCRAM and solely use PLAIN.\nIf we, on the other hand, don\u0026rsquo;t assume to always have a MITM-free TLS channel, then the above listed properties 2, 4 and 5 are all not fulfilled (that means: no downgrade prevention, no replay attack prevention and no MITM detection/prevention). The attacker could simply remove every advertised SASL method except PLAIN and thus get the plaintext password which is replayable and neither the server nor the client will detect this MITM. Supporting SCRAM in clients and servers does not help at all with this, because it simply will not be negotiated.\nWell, okay, but XEP-0438: Best practices for password hashing and storage (and some RFC I don\u0026rsquo;t remember) says, we should pin the last used SASL mechanism in the client to prevent downgrade attacks in further SASL sessions. That way the client won\u0026rsquo;t use SASL mechanisms having a perceived lower strength than the pinned one. Using a stronger one is still possible. That\u0026rsquo;s right, but it makes matters worse in regard to protocol agility while still not preventing the downgrade attack for the first connection of a client to the XMPP server.\nBroken protocol agility Protocol agility means we can specify new authentication methods later on and our client will always use the best one advertised by the server. That\u0026rsquo;s important because it allows us to gradually upgrade the security strength of our authentication while still maintaining backwards compatibility with older clients, eventually removing an old authentication method once most/all clients use a newer one (like replacing DIGEST-MD5 or CRAM-MD5 with SCRAM-SHA-XXX).\nSCRAM without PLUS variants Because of SCRAM fulfilling property 3 (preventing storage of plaintext passwords on the server), we can not upgrade the stored password hashes in the server\u0026rsquo;s database to a new SCRAM-based SASL mechanism. The obvious partial solution is to store new user\u0026rsquo;s passwords using the newer SCRAM algorithm and leave the old user\u0026rsquo;s passwords like they are. That way at least some of your users get to use the new SCRAM algorithm, slowly phasing out the old one eventually. An example would be a server that previously only supported SCRAM-SHA-1 now advertising support for SCRAM-SHA-256.\nOh, no! That doesn\u0026rsquo;t work either! The current specification of SASL in XMPP does send the list of supported SASL methods to the client before knowing which username the client wants to authenticate for. That means the server will always advertise SCRAM-SHA-256, even if the hash in the database is still SHA-1. If the client supports SCRAM-SHA-256 as well, it will happily pick that one and the server, only having the SHA-1 hash at hand, won\u0026rsquo;t be able to authenticate the user. The client on the other hand will have no way to detect why the authentication failed and switch to a percieved lower strength SASL algorithm (and even if that would be possible, it could possibly be used as a downgrade vector if done wrong).\nWell, method pinning to the rescue! We already talked about SASL method pinning. The client obviously knows which SASL method it used the last time it authenticated successfully and can always use just this method, no other, even if it implements some having a higher strength. That extends the pinning described in XEP-0438: Best practices for password hashing and storage to algorithms having a higher strength as well, something that, to my knowledge, isn\u0026rsquo;t specified anywhere. Additionally, that means we completely loose protocol agility after our first authentication. And newly offering SCRAM-SHA-256 on a server not storing plaintext passwords after it previously only advertised SCRAM-SHA-1 will likely still break authentication for all clients not doing this exact \u0026ldquo;always use the mechanism used on first auth\u0026rdquo; pinning.\nThe only way to advertise support for a new SCRAM hash algorithm and make clients use it is to upgrade your complete password database on the server by forcing a password reset upon all of your existing users. This must presumably be done out of band for XMPP. Clients implementing the strict pinning outlined above will have to reset the pinning once a new password gets entered by the user. If they don\u0026rsquo;t do so, this strict pinning to the old algorithm will still be in place and this client won\u0026rsquo;t be able to authenticate the user after the password reset.\nAnd I\u0026rsquo;ve not even started to talk about a user having two clients, one that only supports an old SCRAM algorithm (say SCRAM-SHA-1) and one that supports a new one (say SCRAM-SHA-256). The server obviously must store both hashes in its database to allow logins for both clients.\nSounds all pretty bad, right? How come, that hasn\u0026rsquo;t been discovered yet? Well, someone already identified these problems back in 2019. See this thread on the standards@xmpp.org mailinglist. But no attempt was made to fix them. Even the new XEP-0388: Extensible SASL Profile still uses the same protocol flow with no fix, albeit allowing for additional handshakes during the authorization phase like pipelining a bind request or resumption via XEP-0198: Stream Management onto the authorization.\nSidenote: One could solve this mess by sacrificing property 3 (not storing plaintext passwords on the server). If the plaintext password is stored on the server, every SCRAM algorithm can be used by the client. But do we really want that? At least that would allow the server to advertise new SCRAM algorithms without having to force a password reset.\nSCRAM with PLUS variants When looking at the channel-binding situation we already saw that the client specifies the type of channel-binding it wants to use. That allows for protocol agility, right?\nNo! The client does not have any way to detect which channel-binding type the server supports (appending -PLUS to the advertised SCRAM algorithm does not in any way specify which channel-binding to use). And if the client uses the wrong channel-binding the server does not support, the server will simply fail the authentication. The client will have no way to detect if the authentication failed because of the wrong channel-binding type used or if the actual password was wrong, like with using the \u0026ldquo;wrong\u0026rdquo; SASL algorithm above.\nThis renders the whole channel-binding protocol agility completely useless. And protocol agility is needed even for channel-binding!\nSome Solutions Well, that\u0026rsquo;s pretty bad news, right? But I don\u0026rsquo;t want to simply rant and leave the shard for someone else to collect, but propose fixes instead. And to my knowledge some of these problems are really fixable.\nIn this section I want to propose fixes to at least some of these problems. These fixes are open to debate and if we come up with even better solutions during this debate, that\u0026rsquo;d be great.\nRestoring protocol agility for channel-binding The server must not use -PLUS to indicate SCRAM algorithms with channel-binding, but use the name of the concrete channel-binding type as SCRAM algorithm suffix. That way the client will be able to determine if it supports that type of channel-binding and only select those SCRAM algorithms having a channel-binding it supports. The server is only allowed to advertise channel binding methods supported by the currently used channel (e.g. don\u0026rsquo;t advertise tls-unique on a TLS 1.3 channel, but only tls-exporter (if implemented)). Clients and servers may choose to still support the -PLUS SCRAM method names in addition to these new ones containing the concrete channel-binding type, but I don\u0026rsquo;t think that gets us anywhere.\nSome examples: SCRAM-SHA-1_TLS-UNIQUE or SCRAM-SHA-512_TLS-EXPORTER. That, of course, does not help at all, if channel-binding support can be rendered useless by a downgrade attack.\nPreventing downgrade of SASL methods Downgrades can be prevented by only allowing SASL EXTERNAL and SCRAM methods (or something similar to SCRAM that then mutual authenticates the whole protocol flow). The SCRAM client-final message must contain a client proof built using a HMAC not only covering the client-first-message-bare, server-first-message and client-final-message-without-proof, but also the (sorted) SASL method list. That allows the server to verify if the client used the correct list and this could not be manipulated, because it is ultimately signed with the client password, a MITM attacker can not know.\nWe can achieve this by adding an optional SCRAM attribute to client-first-message-bare which will be ignored by non-supporting servers, but secure the handshake against downgrades on supporting servers. This attribute (let\u0026rsquo;s name it d) will contain a base64-encoded hash of the sorted SASL method list as received by the client (using the same hash method as used in the whole SCRAM stuff). The server then checks if that hash matches the one it calculated itself by hashing the sorted SCRAM method list it advertised and fail the authentication, if these hashes don\u0026rsquo;t match.\nThe sorting can be done alphabetical in ascending order and the individual SASL methods be separated by \u0026lt; like done in XEP-0115: Entity Capabilities before the whole string is hashed.\nWe now have a working downgrade attack prevention that\u0026rsquo;s even backwards compatible with existing SCRAM methods and servers not supporting this new SCRAM attribute.\nRestoring protocol agility for SASL methods part #1 First of all, the server will have to store SCRAM hashes (or something similar for non-scram methods) for all methods it does support. If the server operator later decides to not offer a specific SASL method anymore, they can delete the (hash) data stored for that method from their server.\nSecond, the server can only advertise those methods it has hashes for in its database. That means it needs to know the username before advertising which methods it supports. This requires a change in the protocol flow for mechanism negotiation, which is not codified in the SASL RFC and can be changed via XEP. A good candidate would be XEP-0388: Extensible SASL Profile (also dubbed SASL2) which is not yet in Final state and thus can be adjusted to our needs.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s assume a SASL2 protocol flow by advertising support for this protocol, but not simultaneously advertising which SASL methods the server supports. The client would then first send the desired username it wants to authenticate for, and the server would respond with a list of supported SASL mechanisms for exactly this user. The username is of course not safe from a MITM attacker, but it will be included in the SCRAM authentication flow and the server will fail the authentication if that user differs from the one given earlier.\nAn example protocol flow using a modified SASL2 might look as follows (resembling more or less a normal SCRAM flow):\n\u0026lt;!-- Server sends stream features indicating support for SASL2. --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;stream:features\u0026gt; \u0026lt;authentication xmlns=\u0026#39;urn:xmpp:sasl:1\u0026#39;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/stream:features\u0026gt; \u0026lt;!-- Client intiates authentication by sending the base64 encoded username it wishes to authenticate for. --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;request xmlns=\u0026#39;urn:xmpp:sasl:1\u0026#39;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;user\u0026gt;dXNlcg==\u0026lt;/user\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/request\u0026gt; \u0026lt;!-- Server sends the list of supported mechanisms for this user.

To solve this, the server offers new SASL mechanisms indicating that he allows for hash upgrades, if he doesn\u0026rsquo;t have all required hashes in its database yet. The ordering of these new upgrade mechanisms should use a stable sorting algorithm. First sorting by perceived strength of the algorithm updated to, then by the percieved strength of the algorithm used for authentication (e.g. use the highest strength for authentication and upgrade to the highest strength possible with this authentication).\nFor reference, the SCRAM flow as stated in RFC 5802 section 3 is as follows, with HMAC() and HASH() corresponding to the hash method used to authenticate (e.g. SHA-256 for SCRAM-SHA-256):\nSaltedPassword := Hi(Normalize(password), salt, i) ClientKey := HMAC(SaltedPassword, \u0026#34;Client Key\u0026#34;) StoredKey := H(ClientKey) AuthMessage := client-first-message-bare + \u0026#34;,\u0026#34; + server-first-message + \u0026#34;,\u0026#34; + client-final-message-without-proof ClientSignature := HMAC(StoredKey, AuthMessage) ClientProof := ClientKey XOR ClientSignature ServerKey := HMAC(SaltedPassword, \u0026#34;Server Key\u0026#34;) ServerSignature := HMAC(ServerKey, AuthMessage) The SaltedPassword is the hash saved in the database on the server alongside the salt. Using additional SASL2 tasks we can now require the client to perform an additional task which consists of sending the SaltedPassword for the hash algorithm to upgrade to. The server just provides the required salt (that must be a new random value not equal to the one used for the old hash) and iteration count. By providing the salted hash after the successful completion of our SCRAM authentication, server and client can be sure to talk to the right one and when channel-binding is used, both can be sure no MITM is involved that could intercept the new SaltedPassword. I strongly suggest to only support password upgrades if channel-binding is used.\nAn example protocol flow using a modified SASL2 might look as follows (resembling more or less the SCRAM flow used in part #1 above and adding a second task for the desired hash upgrade):\n\u0026lt;!-- Server sends stream features indicating support for SASL2. --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;stream:features\u0026gt; \u0026lt;authentication xmlns=\u0026#39;urn:xmpp:sasl:1\u0026#39;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/stream:features\u0026gt; \u0026lt;!-- Client intiates authentication by sending the base64 encoded username it wishes to authenticate for. --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;request xmlns=\u0026#39;urn:xmpp:sasl:1\u0026#39;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;user\u0026gt;dXNlcg==\u0026lt;/user\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/request\u0026gt; \u0026lt;!-- Server sends the list of supported mechanisms for this user.

This is no \u0026ldquo;do everything once\u0026rdquo; anyways, because not every client might support every upgrade possible.\nConclusion To conclude this, we now identified several improvements to regain the properties listed in the beginning. These improvements can mainly be achieved by updating the SASL2 XEP (XEP-0388: Extensible SASL Profile). The downgrade prevention (the additional SCRAM attribute d) should possibly be published as RFC, but a XEP could suffice, too.\nFeel free to comment on anything in here. I\u0026rsquo;m always open to feedback and improvements. Just contact me at thilo@monal-im.org.\n","permalink":"https://monal-im.github.io/monal-im.org/post/00004-sasl/","summary":"SASL (Simple Authentication and Security Layer) as used in XMPP is broken. In this blog post I\u0026rsquo;ll try to explain why and propose some fixes.\nUpdate: Since I originally wrote this blog post, I\u0026rsquo;ve had the ability to discuss several of my solutions with Dave (the original author of XEP-0388 dubbed SASL2) and MattJ (one of the authors of the prosody xmpp server) and others. Most, if not all of my issues are now addressed in a bunch of updates to existing XEPs as well as new XEPs:","title":"On the state of SASL in XMPP"},{"content":"We are pleased to announce that we got funding by the EU’s NGI Assure via the NLnet Foundation to work on some important features in Monal.\nIn short this consists of the following tasks (in no special order).\n1. Implement more privacy-friendly push server The current push appserver (https://github.com/tmolitor-stud-tu/mod_push_appserver) saves more data than strictly needed to perform its task, let’s change that. On top of that, a possible HA-setup and load balancing should be strived for.\n2. Implement basic Audio calls using WebRTC Include WebRTC library into our codebase and wire it up to allow for simple audio calls not involving XMPP (maybe send SDP data through a Monal specific non-standardized XMPP stanza to make this work without hardcoded ip and port).\nThis is to test Audio Calls in the field first before wiring them up using correct XMPP XEPs.\n3. Implement all XEPs needed for Audio Calls To make Audio Calls for XMPP work, we need proper XMPP integration. This wires up the stuff implemented in (2) into the XMPP layer by implementing the proper XEPs listed below. This will add support for 1:1 audio calls to Conversations, Dino and many more XMPP clients.\n4. Implement Video calls using WebRTC On top of the work done in (2) and (3) we want to implement Video Call support as well. This will add support for 1:1 video calls to Conversations, Dino, and more.\n5. Security quickscan We want a security quickscan performed by Radically Open Security and implement mitigations for problems found by them.\n6. Implement MUC UI management (add/remove/promote users etc.) While Monal supports MUCs (multi user chats) in its flavours “channel” and “group”, the app is still lacking proper support for creating and managing group-type MUCs. We will implement that missing piece in this task.\n7. Port addContact UI to SwiftUI The existing UI to add a contact or show pending contact requests is not user-friendly. We will therefore port it to SwiftUI. Once contacts can be added using the new UI, a UI for creating MUCs will be added. Monal will then support the creation of new private MUCs. Additionally, the existing functionality to scan contact QR-Codes and open contact links from other apps / iOS camera will be refactored. After the refactoring the user can preview the action and select an appropriate account before adding the contact.\n8. Add SASL mechanism upgrade capability to XEP-0388 XEP-0388 (“Extensible SASL Profile”) modernizes the old XMPP SASL profile defined in RFC 6120 and reduces round-trips. But neither the old SASL profile nor the new one (dubbed SASL2) solve the problem of SASL mechanism upgrades. A server that saves the hashed password for SCRAM-SHA-1 authentication has no way of upgrading to SCRAM-SHA-256. It does not know the cleartext password to calculate the hash to store itself and no way to ask the client for it. We want to take the opportunity and update the SASL2 XEP before it gets widely deployed to provide a way for a smooth upgrade path that allows the servers to store multiple hashes and get new hashes provided by clients that support the new algorithm without the need of ever knowing the cleartext password.\n9. Implement SASL2 in Monal (including SCRAM SHA1, SHA256 and SHA512) Implement the updated SASL2 XEP and the accompanying XEP-0440 (“SASL Channel-Binding Type Capability”) in Monal which serves as foundation for the implementation of XEP-0397 (“Instant Stream Resumption”).\n10. Write new XEP for downgrade protection of channel-binding types and SASL mechanisms and implement it A Man-In-The-Middle capable of impersonating the XMPP server on the TLS level can use SASL Mechanism Stripping and/or strip channel-binding types to downgrade the security. Adding an optional SCRAM attribute containing the hash of all server-advertised SASL mechanisms and channel-binding types as seen by the client will enable the server to check if any downgrade took place and to abort the authentication, if so. Because the SCRAM attribute will be part of the mutual authentication between client and server, a MITM will not be able to forge it as long as SCRAM is used at all.\n","permalink":"https://monal-im.github.io/monal-im.org/post/00003-nlnet-funding/","summary":"We are pleased to announce that we got funding by the EU’s NGI Assure via the NLnet Foundation to work on some important features in Monal.\nIn short this consists of the following tasks (in no special order).\n1.

To overcome these limitations your XMPP-Server can can request our push server to send push messages to Apple. With these push messages we can request Apple to wake up the app on your phone. Once it is woken up it has about 30 seconds to connect to your XMPP server, fetch all new messages and show a push notification for these new messages.\nHow push works Every time that Monal logins at your XMPP servers, it requests your server to inform us once your received an XMPP message while Monal was closed. We therefore requests a Monal specific push token from Apple. Using this Monal specific push token our push server can send push messages via Apples push system to wake up the app on your device.\nOnce push messages are enabled for your Monal instance on your XMPP servers, your XMPP servers will open a encrypted server to server (s2s) connection to one of our push servers. Using this s2s connection your XMPP servers will then request our push servers to wake up Monal every time that new messages should be processed. To wake up your instance your XMPP servers send us:\nyour unique Monal specific push token that was generated by Apple the domain of the XMPP server that you are using. Push We never see your messages. We do not know who you are chatting with. We could only ever track what XMPP domains a push token is/was using. We can not identify a user. Push-Servers We provide two independent push server regions at the moment: Europe and US. By default, each device will choose our Europe based push region unless the device local is set to the US.\nHow to change the push region Open Monal Open up the settings menu in the upper left corner (gearwheel) Open the Notifications menu Scroll down Select a region Push server regions If you are an XMPP server administrator, and you restricted s2s connections, please allow s2s to all our regions.\nRegion Hostname Notice Europe eu.prod.push.monal-im.org US us.prod.push.monal-im.org Push server locations Name Region Hoster Location Notice s1.eu.prod.push.monal-im.org Europe Hetzner Finland s2.eu.prod.push.monal-im.org Europe PHP-Friends Germany s1.us.prod.push.monal-im.org US Fosshost US IPv4 only s2.us.prod.push.monal-im.org US Fosshost US Crash reports and app usage Monal does track crashes and usage data anonymously using the tools provided by Apple. This is opt-in only and controlled by iOS and macOS global settings. If a user decides not to send any data to developers, no crash logs are sent to Monal developers.\nLogs Your local device will contain a log file with all sent and received raw XMPP messages as well as debug logs. It does contain sensitive personal data! This file will never be transferred to us, except if you explicitly (manually) send it to us (e.g. via mail).\nGDPR Subject Access Requests (SAR) European GDPR allows users to request a copy of all data retained about them. Starting with Monal 5.2.0 we no longer see your JIDs (username@domain.tld) in our push servers. We therefore are not able to send you retained data related to your JID. We furthermore are unable to provide your retained data related to your unique push token because we have no way to verify that Apple issued you a provided device ID. If you have questions regarding GDPR, please send us a mail to info@monal-im.org.\nMonal (App \u0026lt; 5.2.0) Monal for iOS and macOS will register for APNS push notifications via a server to server (s2s) connection from your XMPP server to our push server. Your XMPP JID alongside with a push identifier and secret token from Apple, that is only valid for this app, will be saved and logged in the push-server logs. We do not intend to track you. All server logs are purged every two weeks. Our logs allow us to see the following details:\nYour JID (including your server’s hostname) Time when you register for push notifications Your apple push node and push token that was generated for Monal by Apple Time when your XMPP server triggered a push notification to your Monal device To fulfill its duty, our push server has to hold some information associated with an Apple push token, until Apple marks the token a deleted, which usually means you have uninstalled the app (Info: Apple confirms if a token is still valid on every push). In detail these information consists of:\nThe Apple push token The timestamp of the last push error The timestamp of the last successful push The timestamp of the registration of your device with Monal’s push-server The timestamp when the registration was renewed A random UUID identifying your device A random secret used by your XMPP server to authenticate a push Push server locations Name Hoster Location Notice ios13push.monal.im AWS US Provided by Anurodh Pokharel\nIPv4 only push.monal.im AWS US Provided by Anurodh Pokharel\nIPv4 only\niOS 12 only Crash reports and app usage Monal does track crashes and usage data anonymously using the tools provided by Apple.

We successfully managed to transform Monal from an app that had flaws and issues with many functions to a level that promotes a user-friendly experience with working features such as push notification, group chat, and partially end-to-end encryption support (OMEMO). If you are selecting an XMPP client for Apple systems we think that Monal is a great choice nowadays. We have been investing more than a thousand hours and worked hard to overcome all the flaws, the legacy app had. We invite you to give the recent beta a try!\nThe development of Monal has not yet finished though, and many more features are hopefully to come. But due to our time constraints, it sometimes takes a bit longer than we and the community would like. We are at most two developers at the moment using our spare time to maintain Monal and develop new features. As we are developing Monal in our spare time without decent funding, it is sometimes hard to prioritize specific features. Please give this circumstance some credits.\nWhat should Monal look like in the future? To give you a bit of insight knowledge of our plans we tried to summarize the most important tasks.\nInterface (SwiftUI) In the future Monal should be easy to use. Therefore, the interface requires a proper rework and while we are at it, it should be ported to SwiftUI. While we are still improving in designing with SwiftUI, we would be glad if there is a SwiftUI \u0026amp; Open Source enthusiast who would like to help us with this.\nWith this transition we would like to improve the accessibility of the app as well. If you like to support an open source project, and you would like to be part of our SwiftUI journey please contact us.\nTask:\nAdd new MUC creation and management UI Port the chat view Finish contact Details List group chat (MUC) participants Display OMEMO encryption fingerprints for verification Port our settings Port all other remaining views Qualifications:\nGeneral knowledge around SwiftUI (iOS and Catalyst) Interest in improving a (XMPP) chat client Optional, but preferred: Some experience with XMPP (e.g. some weeks, or maybe months of usage of Monal or any other “modern” XMPP client) Optional: Experience in designing inclusive / accessible UI Website We need a modern (simplified) Hugo based website that is easier to understand, similar to Conversations, Dino or Gajim.\nIf you have some spare time, and you are a skilled in creating websites with Hugo please contact us.\nRequirements:\nSimple design nothing too fancy Privacy by design → No analytics, no external CSS, jss, … usage OMEMO Encryption in Group Chat (MUC) We started to integrate OMEMO for group chats (MUC) into our alpha build. The receiving and sending sides are already implemented, but there are a few more steps until we can release it into the beta.\nSwitching to our new Domain monal-im.org In late 2021 we decided that we would like to have a domain with DNSSEC as our current top level domain does not support it. This domain will mainly be used for our push servers and mail servers in the future. From now on you will be able to reach us via info@monal-im.org.\nBuild server Thanks to ~20 generous donors, we were able to buy a new build server that will be used to build our alpha, beta and stable releases. Furthermore, Thilo is now finally able to debug code with a proper debugger connected to his phone.\nRedundant Push Servers We are currently using an AWS US instance for our push server that is not redundant and failed in 2021 more frequently than we liked it to. For that reason we started an internal project to auto-deploy our push server with Ansible and looked into ways for running a redundant push server setup. The first tests look promising so far, but a few more things need to be sorted out before we can switch over to our new setup.\nBefore we can switch to the new push server setup, we need a stable funding each month. We estimate that renting a VM in Germany and one at a different hoster in Finland would cost us between 16€ to 32€ each month. Without a stable funding we might not be able to afford this new setup and our push servers would stay in the US.\nThanks to our generous build server donors, we have a few bucks left that will be used as a ~5 month buffer in case of fluctuant push server funding\nPrivacy improved push servers With our current push implementation our so-called “app servers” see your JID (username + server), a unique but otherwise opaque device id and an opaque token generated by apple, as well as your interaction times (when you register for push notifications, timestamps when your XMPP server triggers a push notification device).\nIf you use multiple accounts on one device, the unique device id is shared across all accounts. We don’t think that this is ideal, as we know all jid’s a user is using.\nIn the future we want to try to reduce our knowledge by hiding your username from our app servers. If our idea works, we would only see that a device is registered on one or more domains and the timestamps that a push message was triggered from each domain that is used.\nAudio and Video Calls Many clients such as Conversations and Dino support audio and video calls, so Monal should be next 🙂\nEnd-of-life: iOS 12, iOS 13 and macOS Catalina will not be supported anymore Our user group on iOS 12, iOS 13 as well as macOS Catalina has decreased in last years while the resources needed to maintain these old platforms increased. We therefore decided to focus on newer iOS versions and drop the old ones. The next stable release will only be supported on iOS 14 and higher and macOS Big Sur and higher. We are still unsure how long we will support iOS 14, as most of the devices also support iOS15.\nDonations and Support Monal is developed by volunteers and community collaboration. The work which has been done is usually not paid, and the developers need to keep up service costs and development in the future! Please consider giving a bit back for the hard work which has been conducted. Currently, there are three ways to financially support the Monal development:\nDonate via GitHub Sponsors Donate via Libera Pay EU citizens can donate via SEPA, too.
