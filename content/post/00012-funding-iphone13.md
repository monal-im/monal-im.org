Our current development iPhone 8, which we bought in 2020, is getting on in years, is not able to run iOS 17 and the battery is broken.

So it's that time again: we are launching a new fundraising campaign for **350** EUR to finance a new development iPhone capable of running iOS 17 and several upcoming iOS versions.
Currently we are aiming for an **iPhone 13**.
